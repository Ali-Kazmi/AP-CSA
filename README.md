# AP-CSA
AP Computer Science A. Taken at EVHS senior year (Junior year was AP Computer Science Principles, which I also got an A in and later a 5/5 on the exam). Only posting some of the labs and projects. This was an introductory Java course, and I got an A. Here are some of the topics covered: strings, arrays (including multidimensional and jagged), arraylists, methods, OOP, inheritance, abstract classes, algorithms (and big O), importing, etc. In the end it seems like a standard intro course in java.
