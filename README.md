# AP-CSA
AP Computer Science A. Taken at EVHS senior year (Junior year was AP Computer Science Principles). Only posting some of the labs and projects. It was an introductory Java course, and I got an A. Here are some of the topics covered: strings, arrays (including multidimensional and jagged), arraylists, methods, OOP, inheritance, abstract classes, algorithms (and big O), importing, etc. In the end it seems like a standard intro course in java.
